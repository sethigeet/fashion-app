# Running the App

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies first.
2. Run `npm run start` to start the development server.
3. Step 2 will open a browser window that will show the processes being run
4. You can now either run the app in an emulator or on an actual phone.
5. If you want to run the app on an emulator, you can click run on android emulator from the web interface after you have started the emulator.
6. If you want to run it on an actual phone, you can install the `expo` app from the Google Play Store, connect to the same local internet that the computer is connected to and then scan the QR code from the app that is displayed on the web interface or in the terminal
